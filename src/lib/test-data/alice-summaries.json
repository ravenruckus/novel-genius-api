    "summary": "Alice, bored by her sister's book, sees a White Rabbit with a pocket watch who declares he's late. Intrigued, she follows him down a rabbit-hole, falling slowly into a well-like tunnel.  She observes shelves and wonders about her fall's depth and geographic location. Reaching the bottom unharmed, she spots the Rabbit again and follows him into a hall with locked doors. She discovers a tiny golden key that unlocks a small passage leading to a beautiful garden. Unable to fit through the doorway, Alice finds a bottle labeled \"DRINK ME\" and drinks it, shrinking to ten inches tall.  Though now small enough for the door, she's forgotten the key on the table and can't reach it.  She finds a cake labeled \"EAT ME,\" hoping it will change her size again so she can retrieve the key and enter the garden."

Alice questions her identity as she shrinks. She encounters a Mouse in the pool and tries to converse with it, but her mentions of cats and dogs offend the Mouse.

    "summary": "Alice finds herself surrounded by a group of wet and grumpy animals, all trying to dry off after a swim.  A Mouse attempts to dry them with a history lesson, but is constantly interrupted by the other animals.  The Dodo suggests a Caucus-race to dry off, which proves to be a nonsensical event where everyone wins. Alice gives away comfits as prizes and receives her own prize: a thimble.  She then asks the Mouse to finish its story about why it hates cats and dogs. The Mouse's story, however, is just a long and winding poem.  Alice's inability to pay attention offends the Mouse, who storms off.  Alice regrets mentioning her cat, Dinah, as her talk of Dinah's hunting skills scares away the other animals.  Alone and sad, Alice wonders if she will ever see her beloved cat again. "

    "summary": "Alice encounters a Caterpillar smoking a hookah. The Caterpillar repeatedly asks Alice “Who are _you?_”, questioning her identity as she has changed sizes multiple times throughout the day.  Alice admits she doesn’t know who she is anymore, unable to remember things properly and constantly changing sizes.  The Caterpillar challenges her by asking her to recite a poem, “How doth the little busy bee”, and then “You are old, Father William”, which Alice recites incorrectly due to her state. The Caterpillar questions if Alice believes she has changed, to which she expresses her confusion and frustration with her unstable size.  The Caterpillar, being three inches tall itself, tells Alice that her current size is a good height, but she disagrees as she is not used to it.  Before leaving, the Caterpillar advises Alice that eating one side of the mushroom will make her grow taller, while the other side will make her shorter.  Alice, unsure which side is which, takes a bite from the right-hand bit, causing her foot to hit her chin as she shrinks rapidly.  Panicked, she eats the left-hand bit and her neck grows immensely long, resembling a serpent.  A Pigeon mistakes Alice for a serpent, expressing its frustration with serpents trying to steal its eggs. Alice tries to clarify she is not a serpent, but a little girl, but the Pigeon doesn’t believe her due to her long neck.  After the Pigeon returns to its nest, Alice uses the remaining mushroom pieces to return to her normal size.  She then comes across a small house and decides to shrink herself down to nine inches tall before approaching it, fearing she would frighten its inhabitants otherwise."
